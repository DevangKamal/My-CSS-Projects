    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger[9] on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", was coined by
      Peter
      Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com
      in
      April or May 1999.[10][11][12] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and
      verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term "blogger"
      in
      connection with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.[13]The term "weblog"
